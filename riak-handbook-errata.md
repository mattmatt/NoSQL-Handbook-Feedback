Page numbers refer to the PDF version. In other versions, the page number is in no way meaningful.

* Page 11: "A lower W involves less nodes"; should be "fewer nodes"
* Page 11: "The first R nodes to return the requested alue"; should be "value"
* Page 11: "The optimum for consistency lies i choosing"; should be "in"
* Page 14: "In a truly distributed environment, and when rites involve quorums"; "rites" should be "writes"
* Page 15: "The result gets worth as you add more nodes."; "worth" should be "worse"
* Page 15: "Not only is that a very expensive operation, it defeats the purpose of adding new nodes"; "it defeats" could perhaps be "it also defeats" or "but it also defeats"
